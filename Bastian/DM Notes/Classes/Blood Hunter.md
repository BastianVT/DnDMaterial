The blood hunter is mostly similar. However there are some key changes.

Before starting the crimson rite, the blood hunter will choose a target and draw a mark on the victim. It will light up and will be shown on full display. The target and everyone around them will realise that they have been marked and they will have to make a wisdom saving throw. If they fail, they are frightened.

The blood hunter loses permanent health (die depends on the level). They can get the health back if they kill the target. They take the soul of the individual and merge it with their own. This makes it so that their soul won't be corrupted. Depending on the element that the ki contains, the next blood rite will look and act different.
