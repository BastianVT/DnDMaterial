The [[Quantum eclipse]] is the phenomenon where [[The Quantum Moon]] blocks the sun.

A full [[Quantum eclipse]] happens every 1100 years. Every 11 years it covers it up more and more until it is fully covered after 1100 years. 

During a full [[Quantum eclipse]], the veil between [[material plane]] and [[Spirit plane]] becomes the smallest. The [[spiritual gate]] is a forceful choice that opens up a rift that connects the two. However it is still not possible for larger beasts to get through.
