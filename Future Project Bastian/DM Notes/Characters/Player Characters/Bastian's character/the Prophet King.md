#NPC

[[the Prophet King]] is the father of [[Bastian's character]].

The father believes that he is a descendant of [[The first]]. He is the ruler of the [[Prophet king's empire]]. His goal is to expand in the same way that [[The first]] did and create a unified continent.

He enlisted the help of the warlock [[Itti]]. She became her right hand man and played in on his delusions that he was destined. 

During the [[Quantum eclipse]] by effect of [[The Quantum Moon]] blocking the sun, the veil between the [[material plane]] and the [[Spirit plane]] becomes thinnest. As the ritual was there to preserve life, due to deception by [[Itti]], the power that was focused towards [[the Prophet King]] was directed into breaking loosening the veil. This will be called [[The Fracture]]. This is the reason that ghastly monsters have started to roam the realm sparsely.
