CHARACTER COUSIN: EVERYTHING REMAINS THE SAME
WOUNDED BY WAR

[[Cuauhtémoc]] has fled the [[Prophet king's empire]] a few years after [[Itti]] joined as a humble painter. He found that there was something wrong with the woman and insisted to [[the Prophet King]] that he should let go of her if he really wants to fulfill his destiny. He was ignored and pushed to the side until eventually he decided to leave the dimension and go to [[Vidya Vriksha]] on boat. 

During [[Bastian's character]]'s childhood, he made sure to spend time with him when his own father was too busy leading the people. Due to this, he received an affinity for [[Cuauhtémoc]]. After hearing about [[Cuauhtémoc]]'s departure, a part of [[Bastian's character]] self-conceitedness saw it as a betrayal of him as a person.
