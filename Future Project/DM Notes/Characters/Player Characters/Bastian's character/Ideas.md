Ideas (you can take whatever you like): 

1.- The dome is now broken/about to be broken

2.- My father or/and I was poisoned (or rumbleball'd) protected by the jaguar spirit from death

3.- The ritual brought me back from the jaguar state (and granted powers) 

4.-3 spirit guardians exist to restore balance (oqho - jaguar - earth/kun - owl - sky/vira - snake - sea) + sun (maybe pokemon emerald) 
-I like this one the most, maybe chi'ita is sky one, kartur/someone else is the snake one-
