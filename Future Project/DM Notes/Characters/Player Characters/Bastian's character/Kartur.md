Genasi prodigy, due to merit quickly ascended through the ranks. Brilliant, stoic and efficient. Despised by other high society members due to being genasi (hates them back and self). Current religious/military intelligence leader. Can orders executions/disappearences. 

-If following spirits idea I would like Kartur to be the sea spirit. -
