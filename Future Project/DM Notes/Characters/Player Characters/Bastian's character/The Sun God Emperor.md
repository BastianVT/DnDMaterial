#NPC

[[the Prophet King]] is the father of [[Bastian's character]].

The father believes that he is a descendant of [[The first]]. He is the ruler of the [[Prophet king's empire]]. His goal is to expand in the same way that [[The first]] did and create a unified continent.

He enlisted the help of the warlock [[Itti]]. She became her right hand man and played in on his delusions that he was destined. 

During the [[Quantum eclipse]] by effect of [[The Quantum Moon]] blocking the sun, the veil between the [[material plane]] and the [[Spirit plane]] becomes thinnest. As the ritual was there to preserve life, due to deception by [[Itti]], the power that was focused towards [[the Prophet King]] was directed into breaking loosening the veil. This will be called [[The Fracture]]. This is the reason that ghastly monsters have started to roam the realm sparsely.


------------------------

Old emperor: only referred to as 'his majesty' or 'your father', murdered while realizing the ritual and expecting to ascend by sacrificing hundreds of people (he thought it was a necessary evil for the safety of his people). 


Becoming the Sun God Emperor: The ascention ritual requires sacrifice but grants godlike powers - higher the sacrifice/greater the power. 



### DM

I want to change it to "Emperor of the Sun". The relation with the spirit guardians would a little more strong and not just the strength of the sun so to speak.
