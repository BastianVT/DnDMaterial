Makoyaura -Mako- Akkara (uncle) 
Ex-grand councilor. 50-60 yearold, on the fatter side, kind and wise. Now farmer in a village. 
Removal as councilor: Outsiders appeared and were treated nicely and welcomed. Accidental murder of outsider prompted battle and war. Raid and destruction of 3 villages (the dome/empire was bigger back then). Was removed from his role due to pacifist approach while Ytti called for a more bloodthirsty approach. 
Old emperor had to sacrifice people to strengthen the dome but at a smaller size at the expense of his removal. Motivation: Achieve peace and prosperity for akkara.
