#Location #Tairona #City

The [[Prophet king's empire]] lies in the [[Tairona]] region. It used to be the gateway between the [[material plane]] and [[Spirit plane]]. 

The inspiration is close to Macchi Pichu.



After the death of [[the Prophet King]], statues and wall murals were put up to honor him for the great hero he was never able to become. [[Itti]] wanted to show that despite being the new ruler of the [[Prophet king's empire]] that she was still humble by giving paintings to important people in the [[Prophet king's empire]]. These were made to show a display of power, like [[the Prophet King]] 

Atop a huge pyramid that stands above the woods, there is the [[Empire's gate]].
