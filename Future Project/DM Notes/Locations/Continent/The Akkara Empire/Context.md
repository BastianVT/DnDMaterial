The ' inti dome': invisibility system for the empire, weakens over time

The empire has one large city Akkatira - the city of gold. (800k ppl) with an intricate river/canal system: buildings in consecuence are very very vertical (tall) and full of vegetation
+ 8 villages in the jungle/mountain - must pay tribute to empire (300k ppl) 
Booming markets + trade culture
Agriculture + artesanies
Genasi and human live here
Genasi are prone to mistreatment/slavery

Transportation is via big birds (think chocobo from FF) they can run and swim

Strong religious influence - sun priests/bishops/archbishops (warlocks) - funny hats - hierarchical structure with the highest being the grand councilor - the advisor of the emperor (used to be uncle, then Ytti now Kartur - a Genasi) 

Religious/police/military connection, priests are the ones that enforce the law. Two schools of magic: sun magic (fire based) and transmutation into animal monsters (via taking vials of potions like a rumble ball from chopper)
