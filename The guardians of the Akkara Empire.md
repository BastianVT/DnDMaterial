spirit guardians exist to restore balance (oqho - jaguar - earth/kun - owl - sky/vira - snake - sea) + sun (maybe pokemon emerald) 
-I like this one the most, maybe chi'ita is sky one, kartur/someone else is the snake one


### Mythology

"At the first dawn, the Sun would watch over the land, eyes viligant to have no evil be unseen. The Sun's watch was strong and twisted beings could not stay. They fled to the domain of the Moon. At the first dusk, the Moon would gaze with caring eyes to the lands beneath bathing the creatures in gentle serenity. The Sun and Moon did not see eye to eye, but knew that both were essential for live. Eventually, They grew tired and delegated their duties to the  guardians. These guardians were strong and plenty. With the heat of the Sun or the grace of the Moon, they would defend, nurture and strife for a better world. However, those in turn grew tired as well. In the Akkara Empire, guardians came forth once more. Vira, the Torrent, came forth from the scale of a great serpent. Kun, the Gale, came forth out of the feather of a great winged warrior. Oqho, the Tremor, came forth from the tusk of a great lion. These strived to protect what surrounds these mountains and waters. Our fear is that they have gone dormant as well, but remember, if they go to rest then we will become the protectors."
